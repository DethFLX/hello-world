# hello-world
My first repository
Hello everyone! I am but a small minnow, jumping into the belly of this beast we call cryptocurrency to swim with the big fish and become part of the true economic future in our every growing world. I am a parent, a spouse, a small time investor on numerous exchanges (centralized as well as defi), and am now taking a swing at the Github platform to further my experience in interacting with the market.
